## Introduction

Welcome to CRTracker, a one-stop application for students to stay updated with their coursework. On this page, we have highlighted some of the key functionalities of CRTracker through a medium-to-high fidelity prototype designed on Figma. This preview lists out some core functionalities of the prototype like viewing course information, deadlines for coursework, setting up meetings with students and also an advanced tracking capability that lets one compare their performance with the rest of the class. With CRTracker, you can easily monitor your progress, deadlines, and assignments all at one-stop. Our prototype is designed to give you a realistic sense of how the user experience with CRTracker will be.

# SUGGESTIONS:

## Evaluation Study

To evaluate our prototype, we performed a combination of a concurrent think aloud and a wizard-of-oz experiment. We asked subjects to go through the workflow of our prototype, in a simulated environment, and recorded their experiences using the app. At the end, we asked them to talk about areas they think needed important. With this study, we were able to incorporate their feedback and make some changes to our prototype to help enhance the user experience

####  ENABLE PROMPT AFTER ADDING A DISCUSSION FORUM
    
   <img align="left" src="/addDiscussion2.png" alt="My Image">

Some users suggested that there is no error warning before making a post to the discussion forum. Students could possibly make a mistake and post something wrong which they wouldn't want to, so we enabled a prompt after adding a discussion forum to give users a second chance to verify their post. This can prevent users from accidentally posting incomplete or incorrect information.

#### ADD SETTINGS PAGE
   
   <img align="left" src="/setting.png" alt="My Image"> 

Some of the study subjects suggested that this application could possibly be used by people with disabilities, so we added a Settings page to give users the option to change their accessibility. This can help users change font sizes and also make the application friendly for users with color blindness.

#### REMOVE CALENDAR FROM PROFILE PAGE
   
   <img align="left" src="/profile.png" alt="My Image">
   <img align="left" src="/profile2.png" alt="My Image">

Initially, the calendar page was displayed on the home page of the application. Many suggested that this cramped up the home page. For this, we decided to move the calendar out of the home page to reduce cluster and only display it for an individual course, when the user clicks on one of the courses they are enrolled in.

   <br clear="left"/>

####  ADD "CONFIRM" OR "CANCEL" OPTION WHEN EDITING PROFILE
    
   <img align="left" src="/editprofile.png" alt="My Image">

To prevent errors, similar to like what was discussed in the discussion post page, we also added a "Confirm" or "Cancel" option when editing the profile, this can give users a chance to go back and cancel their changes.
    
   <br clear="left"/>
    
   ## Created a reply functionality
    
   <img align="left" src="/reply.png" alt="My Image">
   <img align="left" src="/reply2.png" alt="My Image">

With the feedback received, we also added a reply functionality with the prompt of confirming wheather the user wants to post or not. This gives the user more freedom and makes them less likely to make mistakes.

   <br clear="left"/>
    
#### ADD SEARCH BAR TO STUDENTS PAGE
    
   <img align="left" src="/search2.png" alt="My Image">

Some of the subjets suggested that the list of students in a course could be extremely large and scrolling through the list to find the one you are looking for is not going to be a pleasant experience for the user. For this, we added a search bar when viewing students, this can help users search for specific students in a matter of seconds.
